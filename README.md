# Chrome Extension Development Project Plan


## **1. Project Overview**

This document outlines the project plan for the development of our Chrome Extension. This extension aims to create an interactive open-source textbook experience where users can pose questions and provide answers to facilitate collaborative learning. It will support user interaction, user management, secure data management, compatibility with diverse web pages, and optimal performance.
